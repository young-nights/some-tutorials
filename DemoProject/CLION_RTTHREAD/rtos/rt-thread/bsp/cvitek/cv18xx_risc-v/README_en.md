## Overview
The CV18xx series of chips are high-performance, low-power chips launched for various products in the field of civilian consumer surveillance IP cameras, smart homes, and more. These chips integrate H.264/H.265 video compression encoders, as well as ISP; they support various image enhancement and correction algorithms such as digital wide dynamic range, 3D noise reduction, defogging, and lens distortion correction, providing customers with professional-level video image quality.

2. RT-Smart Edition Toolchain: `riscv64-unknown-linux-musl-gcc` Download Link [https://github.com/RT-Thread/toolchains-ci/releases/download/v1.7/riscv64-linux-musleabi_for_x86_64-pc-linux-gnu_latest.tar.bz2](https://github.com/RT-Thread/toolchains-ci/releases/download/v1.7/riscv64-linux-musleabi_for_x86_64-pc-linux-gnu_latest.tar.bz2)

> Note:
The current bsp only supports Linux compilation, and it is recommended to use Ubuntu 22.04

After correctly extracting, add the local path of the `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc` or `riscv64-unknown-linux-musl-gcc` toolchain to `EXEC_PATH` in `rtconfig.py` or specify the path through the `RTT_EXEC_PATH` environment variable.

```shell
# For RT-Thread Standard Edition, use the following configuration:
$ export RTT_CC_PREFIX=riscv64-unknown-elf-
$ export RTT_EXEC_PATH=/opt/Xuantie-900-gcc-elf-newlib-x86_64-V2.8.1/bin

# For RT-Smart Edition, use the following configuration:
$ export RTT_CC_PREFIX=riscv64-unknown-linux-musl-
$ export RTT_EXEC_PATH=/opt/riscv64-linux-musleabi_for_x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin
```

## Compilation

### Dependency Installation
```shell
$ sudo apt install -y scons libncurses5-dev device-tree-compiler
```

## Modify Current Project Configuration

For the Linux platform, execute:
```shell
$ scons --menuconfig
```

1. By default, compile as RT-Thread Standard Edition. If you need to compile as RT-Smart Edition, modify as follows:
```shell
RT-Thread Kernel  --->
    [*] Enable RT-Thread Smart (microkernel on kernel/userland)

    (0x80000000) The virtual address of kernel start
```

2. Select the current target development board type:
```shell
Board Type (milkv-duo)  --->
    ( ) milkv-duo
    ( ) milkv-duo-spinor
    (X) milkv-duo256m
    ( ) milkv-duo256m-spinor
```

It will automatically download relevant scripts to the ~/.env directory, then execute:
```shell
$ source ~/.env/env.sh
$ pkgs --update
```
After updating the software package, execute `scons -j10` or `scons -j10 --verbose` to compile this board support package. If the compilation is successful, an rtthread.elf file will be generated.

After the compilation is complete, the script automatically calls the `./mksdimg.sh` script to package and generate `boot.sd`, which is the kernel file for SD card startup.

## Running
1. Divide the SD card into 2 partitions, with the first partition used to store bin files, and the second partition used as a data storage partition, with `FAT32` format.
2. Copy the `fip.bin` and `boot.sd` files from the root directory to the first partition of the SD card. Subsequent firmware updates only require copying the `boot.sd` file.
Where:
- fip.bin: fsbl, opensbi, and uboot packaged bin file
- boot.sd: kernel packaged bin file

After updating `boot.sd`, restart to see the serial port output:
